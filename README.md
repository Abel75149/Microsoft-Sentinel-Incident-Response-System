# Microsoft-Sentinel-Incident-Response-System 
## üìå Business Case
Security teams face increasing alert volumes and limited response time. This project implements an automated incident response system using Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Logic Apps to reduce mean time to respond (MTTR), standardize remediation workflows, and improve SOC efficiency.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Automate triage and response to high-fidelity Sentinel incidents
- Integrate with ticketing, messaging, and identity systems
- Reduce manual effort and accelerate containment
- Enable scalable, repeatable security operations

## üßæ Licensing Requirements

| Microsoft Service             | Purpose                                      | Licensing Notes                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Sentinel           | SIEM/SOAR platform                           | Pay-per-GB ingestion or capacity reservation    |
| Azure Logic Apps             | Automation engine for playbooks              | Consumption-based or Standard pricing tiers     |
| Microsoft Defender Products  | Incident sources and response actions        | Requires Defender for Endpoint, Identity, etc.  |
| Microsoft Entra ID (AAD)     | Identity-based triggers and actions          | Included in Microsoft 365 plans                 |

**Recommendations:**
- Use Sentinel capacity reservations for predictable costs
- Assign Logic App managed identities with least privilege
- Ensure Defender products are integrated with Sentinel

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Workflow

1. **Initiate Project**
   - Define incident types to automate (e.g., malware, risky sign-ins)
   - Identify stakeholders: SOC, IT, IAM, Compliance

2. **Design Playbook Architecture**
   - Choose trigger types: analytics rule, incident creation, alert match
   - Define response actions: isolate device, disable user, notify team

3. **Create Logic Apps**
   - Use Azure Logic Apps to build playbooks
   - Include branching logic, approvals, and enrichment steps

4. **Configure Sentinel Automation Rules**
   - Link playbooks to analytics rules or incident triggers
   - Set conditions (e.g., severity, entity type)

5. **Integrate with External Systems**
   - Connect to ServiceNow, Jira, Teams, Slack, or email
   - Use APIs to update tickets or notify stakeholders

6. **Test & Validate**
   - Simulate incidents to test playbook execution
   - Review logs and outputs for accuracy

7. **Deploy to Production**
   - Enable automation rules for live incidents
   - Monitor performance and adjust thresholds

8. **Monitor & Optimize**
   - Track playbook success/failure rates
   - Tune logic and add new use cases over time

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use managed identities for secure Logic App authentication
- Include error handling and logging in all playbooks
- Use tagging and naming conventions for playbook clarity
- Start with semi-automated (approval-based) flows before full automation
- Document each playbook‚Äôs purpose, scope, and rollback steps
- Regularly review automation rules for scope creep or false positives

---

## üìã Project Management Tips

- Assign a playbook owner for each incident type
- Maintain a playbook change log and version history
- Align automation with MITRE ATT&CK and NIST CSF
- Conduct quarterly reviews of automation coverage and gaps
- Train SOC analysts on playbook behavior and override options
